The codebase that we’ll be developing on is a Fake Stack Overflow project (let’s call it HuskyFlow). You will get an opportunity to work with the starter code which provides basic skeleton for the app and then additional features will be proposed and implemented by you! All implementation will take place in the TypeScript programming language, using React for the user interface.",
